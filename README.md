# Tweet Scheduler

## Tools
- Python
  - Imports: flask, os, gspreads, tweepy
- Google Sheets API
- Twitter API
- Heroku(deployment)

## What is it?
This web application prompts the user to provide a message, date & time stamp, and a password. At the scheduled time the application will tweet a tweet from the users account with message as text for the tweet. I primarily made this application to understand more about how to create a flask application and utilize API's. 

You can see how it works below:
